## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, MongoDB

We followed the Model, View, Controller framework. For our model we used Mongoose along with MongoDB to store all of our information. We wrote API's to fetch infromation from MongoDB, used our controllers to render our views. Our Views were made with EJS.

## Optimizations

After completing our project, we also thought of adding the Search bar, which would make it easier for the student to search for books.

## Lessons Learned:

We really liked how it all came together, from authentication to writing API's to fetching information and rendering views. This project taught us a lot of things. While it may not be the best looking project, the project represents the wireframe stage, and allowed us to understand how different components worked together.
